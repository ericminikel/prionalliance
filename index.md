Prion Alliance is a 501(c)(3) non-profit devoted exclusively to advancing scientific research towards a treatment or cure for human prion disease. Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by misfolded proteins and known by various names, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, and Gertsmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker disease. At present, there is no treatment or cure. We &mdash; Sonia Vallabh and Eric Minikel &mdash; founded Prion Alliance as part of our scientific quest after we learned in 2011 that Sonia inherited a genetic mutation that causes prion disease. We are now PhD students in biology at Harvard Medical School, and we are based in Stuart Schreiber's lab at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), where we work on developing therapeutics for human prion disease.
