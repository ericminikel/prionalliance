It's been just over four years since Sonia and I received her genetic test results showing that she had inherited a fatal mutation from her mother. We wanted to know how high her disease risk was, and when we didn't find a satisfying answer in the scientific literature, we set out to answer it ourselves. I'm proud to announce that our findings were published this afternoon, and you can now read:

+ The research paper, [Quantifying prion disease penetrance using large population control cohorts](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/scitransmed/8/322/322ra9.full)
+ A perspective by Dr. Robert C. Green, including the story of how our work changed one patient's prognosis: ["Big Data" gets personal](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/322/322fs3.full)
+ My blog post telling the backstory behind the paper: [Does this mean I'll definitely get the disease?](http://www.cureffi.org/2016/01/20/does-this-mean-ill-definitely-get-the-disease/)
