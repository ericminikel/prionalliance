<p>As of a few minutes ago, <a href="https://www.microryza.com/projects/can-anle138b-delay-the-onset-of-genetic-prion-disease">our first Microryza crowdfunding campaign</a> has just officially finished.  We raised a total of $17,217, which is 215% of our original $8,000 goal and a few hundred more than even our highest &#8220;stretch goal&#8221;.</p>

<p>We will be in touch with lots more updates as things move forward.  But for now, it&#8217;s 3:00 am in Boston, and we just want to say: thank you.  You are all amazing.</p>
