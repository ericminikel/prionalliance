<p>The results of our end-of-the-year push are in, and we raised a total of $5,700 in December &#8211; that&#8217;s $11,400 with our <a title="Donations to Prion Alliance matched 1:1 through end of 2012" href="/2012/12/20/donations-to-prion-alliance-matched-11-through-end-of-2012/">1:1 match</a>.  Amazing!  Thank you so much to everyone who contributed!  You have blown us away with your generosity.  Thanks to your help, we are now well on our way to being able to fund some early efforts on <a title="Prion Alliance partners with all-star team for Rare Disease Challenge" href="/2012/12/17/prion-alliance-partners-with-all-star-team-for-rare-disease-challenge/">our stem cell project for the Rare Disease Challenge</a> and more broadly being able to kick off some of our <a title="Research" href="/research/">research goals</a>.  This early money is going to be crucial in helping us do enough to position ourselves competitively for larger grants over the next several months.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re a bit behind on thank yous and receipts but we&#8217;ll catch up in the next couple of days.    In the meantime, we want to let you know we&#8217;re starting the new year on a note of unbridled optimism and that we are incredibly grateful for all of your support.</p>
<p>2012 was an incredible year. We got Sonia&#8217;s genetic test results in December 2011 &#8211; just over a year ago.  By January 2012 we had embarked on our new adventure of becoming scientists, had enrolled in night classes and started CureFFI.org.  We soon found new jobs in science (Sonia in April, Eric in July), founded Prion Alliance (June), got 501(c)(3) status (October), and in just the past month we&#8217;ve started <a title="Prion Alliance seeking research partners for Rare Disease Challenge" href="/2012/11/11/prion-alliance-seeking-research-partners-for-rare-disease-challenge/">a new research project with a new team</a> and raised $11,400 in our first month of fundraising thanks to generous people like you.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to 2013: an even awesomer year. Thanks for being with us.</p>
