<p>We are proud to announce that Prion Alliance has launched its first fundraising campaign and we are accepting <a title="Donate" href="/donate/">donations</a> online or by check.  Broadly, our goal is to fund research towards a treatment or cure for human prion diseases.  We&#8217;ve been doing our homework over the last several months to understand the current state of prion disease research and what is needed to move the field forward, we have adpoted five <a title="Research" href="/research/">research goals</a> including the testing of potential therapeutics and the development of new disease models and early diagnostic tools.  In the immediate term, our interest is in moving forward our first research goal: validating several potential drugs that have shown efficacy in other mouse models by testing them in FFI knock-in mice, a faithful model of genetic prion disease.  Read more about this research goal <a href="/research/#kimice">here</a>.</p>
<p>We received 501(c)(3) status from the IRS on October 23, so donations are fully tax-deductible.  Thanks in advance for your support.</p>
