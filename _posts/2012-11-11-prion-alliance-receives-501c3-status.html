<p>Good news: in a Letter of Determination dated October 23, 2012, the Internal Revenue Service has granted 501(c)(3) tax exempt status to Prion Alliance, Inc.!  We are now a federally recognized non profit organization and your donation to us will be tax-deductible.  We are almost ready to receive online donations and will begin fundraising this month.</p>
