<p><a href="http://challenge.assaydepot.com/rare-disease-challenge/">Rare Disease Challenge</a> is a contest put on by Assay Depot and Rare Genomics Institute to win $10,000 cash and a total of <a href="http://challenge.assaydepot.com/detailed-list-services/">$400,000 in in-kind donated services from biotech companies</a>.  The idea is that a non-profit group of advocates (that&#8217;s us) team with a group of researchers (that&#8217;s you) to put together a one-page proposal for each prize we want to compete for.  So: a one-pager on what we&#8217;d do with the $10,000, another one-pager on what we&#8217;d do with each donated service that we could use.  <a href="http://challenge.assaydepot.com/rare-disease-science-challenge-submission-form/">The application process</a> is quite simple—it&#8217;s just these short proposals, the principal investigator&#8217;s CV and some contact info.  Once applications are submitted (the deadline is Dec 15) there will be a round of Facebook voting to decide the winner.  Here at Prion Alliance we would love to use this as a chance to further <a title="Research" href="/research/">our research goals</a>, and we&#8217;re happy to do most of the work putting together the proposal and mobilizing our supporters for the voting&#8211; we just need a research partner.  If you&#8217;re interested in joining us, please <a title="Contact" href="/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>
