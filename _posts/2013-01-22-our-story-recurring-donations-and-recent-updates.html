<p>2013 is off to a good start.  Here are a few updates from the past few weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>We received the <a title="Donations to Prion Alliance matched 1:1 through end of 2012" href="/2012/12/20/donations-to-prion-alliance-matched-11-through-end-of-2012/">match</a> for all of your generous December donations, and more donations have continued to come in throughout January pushing us above $12,000 total.  Thanks everyone!</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve added <a title="Our Story" href="/our-story/">our story</a> to the Prion Alliance website.  It proved to be a surprisingly difficult story to actually sit down and write, but now we&#8217;ve finally got something down on the page so people know why we started all of this.</li>
<li>We are now able to accept <a href="/donate/#recurring">recurring monthly donations</a> via PayPal.  It&#8217;s slightly trickier to set up with Amazon, so we haven&#8217;t gotten around to that yet, but if you want to donate each month through Amazon <a title="Contact" href="/contact/">let us know</a> and we&#8217;ll make it a priority!</li>
<li>This month we have been hard at work understanding the science of modeling human diseases using <a href="http://www.cureffi.org/2013/01/21/advances-in-cell-reprogramming/">adult skin cells reprogrammed to neurons</a> and of editing genomes using the &#8216;molecular scissors&#8217; known as <a href="http://www.cureffi.org/2013/01/19/talens-and-zfns/">TALENs and ZFNs</a>.  This is amazing stuff and we are excited to put it into action for studying prion diseases!</li>
</ul>
