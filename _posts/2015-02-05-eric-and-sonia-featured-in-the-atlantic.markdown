Eric and Sonia are featured in [an article](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/insomnia-that-kills/384841/) by Aimee Swartz in The Atlantic today. The article tells their personal story and their decision to devote their lives to science. Thanks to [Joel Watts](http://joelwattslab.org/) for making a cameo with some kind quotes!
