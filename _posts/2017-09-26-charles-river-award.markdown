We are deeply honored to receive the first Research Models in Drug Discovery Award from Charles River Laboratories. The award was presented to us this morning by Charles River CEO Jim Foster at the [World Congress on Animal Models in Drug Discovery and Development](http://breakthroughs.criver.com/index.html), part of Biotech Week Boston. The award recognizes our work to translate fundamental biological understanding of prions into a therapy for human prion disease. After accepting the award, we spoke about the profound ways in which preclinical models of prion disease have informed our efforts and our road ahead to the clinic.

The funds from this award will support our efforts to lay the groundwork for future clinical trials in prion disease. We are deeply grateful to Charles River for their support for our cause.
