<p>Following <a title="Prion Alliance partners with all-star team for Rare Disease Challenge" href="/2012/12/17/prion-alliance-partners-with-all-star-team-for-rare-disease-challenge/">the good news from earlier this week</a>, we now have an amazing donor who will be matching your donations dollar for dollar through midnight on New Year&#8217;s Eve 2012, up to $10,000 matched (i.e. $20,000 total). <a title="Donate" href="/donate/">Donate now</a> before the year is over, and double your donation.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already applied the match to all the donations received in the last two weeks (thanks everyone!), and we&#8217;ll apply it to any other online donations or checks we get before year&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>We would love to use every cent of this opportunity, so our new ambitious goal is to use all $10,000 of match, raising $20,000 in total, by the end of the year. If we do it, we&#8217;ll already be more than halfway to our longer-term goal of $35,000 by the end of March.</p>
<p>The time is now: <a title="Donate" href="/donate/">donate</a>, and tell your friends about it too using the social media links below.</p>
