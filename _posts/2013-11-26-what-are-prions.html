<p><em>This post is part of a series introducing the basics of prion disease. Read the full series <a href="/faq/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>The term <strong>prion</strong> was coined to mean <em>proteinaceous infectious particle</em> [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6801762">Prusiner 1982</a>].  It&#8217;s usually pronounced PREE-on in the U.S. and PRY-on in the U.K. Prions are bits of misfolded protein that have the ability to spread by making other proteins misfold.</p>
<p>The concept and the nomenclature surrounding it are easier to understand with a bit of historical background.</p>
<p>A couple of centuries ago, people started taking note of a unique disease afflicting sheep, which they called <strong>scrapie</strong> because the sheep became deranged and, among other things, started scraping their hindquarters raw. Scrapie was an unusual disease: it seemed to spread like a virus but in other ways it looked like a genetic disease [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14484073/">Parry 1962</a>]. Most peculiar of all, the infectious agent &#8211; whatever it was &#8211; seemed nearly indestructible. Viruses can usually be inactivated by heat and then used in vaccines, but scrapie survives high temperatures. In one notable incident, a herd of sheep were vaccinated against louping-ill virus with a heat-treated sample from other sheep [<a title="Gordon, W. S. &quot;Louping ill, tickborne fever and scrapie.&quot; Vet Rec 58 (1946): 516-525." href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Louping+ill%2C+tickborne+fever+and+scrapie&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C22">Gordon 1946</a>]. The sample turned out to contain scrapie, and many of the inoculated sheep became ill with scrapie as a result.</p>
<p>People studied scrapie for about 150 years without much insight as to the true nature of the disease.  A breakthrough came in the mid-20th century when scientists started studying <strong>kuru</strong>, a neurological disease epidemic in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Carleton Gajdusek won the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1976/">1976 Nobel Prize</a> for demonstrating that kuru could be transmitted to chimpanzees [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5922150">Gajdusek 1966</a>], as could Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), another condition which wreaked havoc on people&#8217;s brains. The damage from CJD looked a lot like that of kuru and scrapie under the microscope.</p>
<p>Soon the nature of the infectious agent became clear. The &#8220;scrapie agent,&#8221; as it used to be called, was a protein [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6801762">Prusiner 1982</a>]. Unlike bacteria and viruses, it has no DNA or RNA. This was a new thing in all of biology, and Stanley Prusiner won the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1997/">1997 Nobel Prize</a> for demonstrating this [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33918/">Prusiner 1998</a>].</p>
<p>So first there was the &#8220;scrapie agent&#8221;, and then this was shown to be an infectious protein which Prusiner dubbed a &#8220;prion&#8221;. Then when Prusiner discovered the protein of which prions were made, he called it &#8220;prion protein&#8221; (PrP for short) [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6418385">Prusiner 1983</a>]. Next it turned out that PrP was a protein that everyone &#8211; even people who aren&#8217;t sick &#8211; have in their bodies, and that there&#8217;s a gene in your DNA, on chromosome 20, that contains instructions telling each cell how to make PrP [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2859120">Oesch 1985</a>]. This gene was eventually called the <em>PRNP</em> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">pr</span>io<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">p</span>rotein) gene.</p>

<p>If everyone has prion protein, then why do most people never get sick with a prion disease? It turns out that PrP normally exists in a healthy state called &#8220;cellular prion protein&#8221; or PrP<sup>C</sup>.  But it&#8217;s capable of misfolding into a &#8220;scrapie prion protein&#8221; or PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. One particle of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can cause other PrP<sup>C</sup> to convert into PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.</p>
<p>In the novel Cat&#8217;s Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut, there&#8217;s a sort of doomsday weapon called <em>ice-nine.</em>  Ice-nine is a fictional water crystal that has a higher melting point than ordinary ice &#8211; it&#8217;s solid at room temperature.  One crystal of ice-nine causes other water molecules to become ice-nine and so it can freeze an entire ocean. PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is like ice-nine: it &#8220;teaches&#8221; the other prion proteins how to fold up into a disease state [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7913989">Kocisko 1994</a>].</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/kvcatscradle.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-460" title="kvcatscradle" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/kvcatscradle.jpg" alt="" width="555" height="403" /></a></p>
<p>When Stanley Prusiner coined the term prion, there weren&#8217;t many known prion diseases &#8211; just kuru, scrapie, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, all of which turned out to be caused by the same protein, PrP. We now know that several other diseases &#8211; mad cow or bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cows, chronic wasting disease in deer, and fatal familial insomnia and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (just call it GSS!) in humans are all prion diseases, also caused by PrP.</p>
<p>And in fact, it turns out that the idea of proteins that can &#8220;teach&#8221; other proteins how to fold isn&#8217;t limited to just PrP. There is now a growing body of scientific evidence to suggest that other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s disease are also caused by different proteins that can act like ice-nine [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22711819">Stohr 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23161999">Luk 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22723400">Prusiner 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24005412">Jucker &amp; Walker 2013</a>]. Even more amazingly, it turns out that the idea of proteins that cause other proteins to fold up like themselves isn&#8217;t <em>always</em> a bad thing. In yeast, it appears to be part of every day life &#8211; yeast cells will divide and pass on their &#8220;prions&#8221; to their daughter cells kind of like they pass on DNA, and those proteins will contain important information that could help the daughter cells survive [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22337056">Halfmann &amp; Jarosz 2012</a>].</p>
<p>So over the past several years, it&#8217;s increasingly common to hear people use the term &#8220;prion&#8221; to refer to amyloid beta (the protein involved in Alzheimer&#8217;s), alpha synuclein (the culprit in Parkinson&#8217;s), and various proteins in yeast. When we say &#8220;prion disease&#8221; here at Prion Alliance, we&#8217;re almost always referring just to the &#8220;original&#8221; prions &#8211; the misfolded PrP particles that cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, and so on. Those are the diseases that we&#8217;ve made it our mission to cure. If you want to be very precise about terminology, you can call these &#8220;PrP prion diseases.&#8221;</p>
