<p>It has been 48 hours since we announced that <a title="Donations to Prion Alliance matched 1:1 through end of 2012" href="/2012/12/20/donations-to-prion-alliance-matched-11-through-end-of-2012/">donations will be matched 1:1 through Dec 31</a>, and we&#8217;ve raised $1,970 so far &#8211; that&#8217;s $3,940 with matching &#8211; and so we&#8217;re about 20% of the way to our goal for the end of the year.  Friends, we are humbled by the outpouring of support and encouragement we&#8217;ve received from everyone over the past several days, evident both in these donations and in the outpouring of kind words we&#8217;ve received from all corners.  Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Here is a quick token of our optimism for the future:</p>
