<p>For years, prion diseases like fatal familial insomnia were considered to be pretty unique: one diseased prion protein (PrP) molecule can transmit disease to another PrP molecule, with no virus, no bacterium—no DNA—required.  Before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_B._Prusiner">Stanley Prusiner</a>&#8216;s Nobel Prize-winning work showing this was really how diseased PrP spreads, this sort of thing was unheard of in all of human (and animal) disease.</p>
<p>In the past few years, researchers have found <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7385/full/nature10875.html">proteins that behave similarly in yeast</a>, and new clues that the Aβ protein involved in Alzheimer&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22711819">may also spread by protein-to-protein interactions</a>.</p>
<p>The big news this past week has been <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3552321/">an impressive new study</a> from UPenn showing the same for Parkinson&#8217;s disease as well.  A protein called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-synuclein">α-synuclein</a> is central to Parkinson&#8217;s disease: plaques of this protein are found in the brains of Parkinson&#8217;s patients, and mutations in the SNCA gene encoding this protein can lead to a genetic form of the disease.  In this new study, researchers injected pre-formed α-synuclein fibrils into the brains of mice and then demonstrated that protein aggregation spreads through the brain from this point of the initial &#8220;seeding&#8221;.  The authors posit that this is how Parkinson&#8217;s disease spreads in the human brain as well.</p>
<p>The notion that Parkinson&#8217;s may spread throughout the brain just like prion disease—that α-synuclein can act, in short, as a prion—is a huge link between the two diseases.  Last week <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324020804578151291509136144.html">the Wall Street Journal explained</a> why mad cow disease (a prion disease caused by diseased PrP) might hold the clues to unraveling Parkinson&#8217;s, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson&#8217;s Research <a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/news-detail.php?wsj-mad-cow-disease-provides-insight-into-parkinson-protein-folding">reported on this message as well</a>.</p>
<p>For those of us interested in a cure for prion disease, this is hopeful news.  The discovery of more similarities between prion diseases and the more common neurodegenerative diseases—Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s—makes it more likely that scientific advances in one disease will help explain things about all of these diseases, and that a treatment strategies developed for one disease might work for others as well.</p>
